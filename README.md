# Pic Of Interest
Description of App:
Pic of Interest will be an Instagram supplement that will promote popular tourist attractions, little known photogenic gems, or locals based on frequency of tags on Instagram. 

Required (core) user stories:
* User will log in through Instagram (or Facebook) or maybe just log in as guest
* After log in, shows a map with user's location (maybe with a marker showing user's exact location in a map) with nearby "locations of interest" within a specified radius displayed (with markers). Have a search app above map where users can search locations. Also a way to filter (scroll view) through different radii and recent times (like "hot" locations and top locations maybe of all time or of last day or month, etc). 
* When you click on marker, you get a description of place, its location, and images taken there


Optional (nice to have) user stories:
* Maybe send notifications when a user is near a "hot" or very popular place.
